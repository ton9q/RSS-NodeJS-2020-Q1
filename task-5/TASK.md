## Task 5. Authentication and JWT

1. `POST /users` should accept **password** field and before save replace it with hash (use [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)).
2. Add a `POST /login` method which accepts json with login and password and should return **JWT** token (use [jsonwebtoken package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)).
3. JWT token should contain **userId** and **login** in a payload.
4. Secret that used for signing the token should be stored in `.env` file
5. For all client requests the JWT token should be added in HTTP **Authorization** header to all requests that requires authentication. HTTP authentication must follow `Bearer` scheme, e.g.:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  ```
6. Add a middleware which will proxy all the requests (except `/login`) and check that HTTP **Authorization** header has the correct value of **JWT** token.
7. In case of the HTTP **Authorization** header in the request is absent or invalid or doesnâ€™t follow `Bearer` scheme, the middleware should stop further router method execution and return HTTP **401** code (Unauthorized error) and the corresponding error message.
8. **Add admin user to DB** on service start with login=admin and password=admin.
