# Typescript basics

Your task is to migrate your project from Javascript to Typescript

* All code files in `src` folder must have `.ts` extension
* There shouldn't be errors of TS compiler and linter
* `eslintrc` and `tsconfig` should be used in the project
* Type `any` is not permitted
* Migration to **Typescript** should not break application functionality
* You can also add [TSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/tsdoc) annotations that contain short functionality description as well as description of its arguments (type, description) and its returned value (if applicable)
